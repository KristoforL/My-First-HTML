# My-First HTML Website
Web Development Work

I am updating this for organization purposes

This was my first try at building a basic web page and adding onto it with the new practices I learned along the way with JS. Instructions to run are below. I will also outline what each page as well as any JS that is in the page and what it is for.

#Setup:

- Download zip of the repository
- Search in the 'About Me' folder for the following file: About_Me_Index.html
- You can right click on 'About_Me_Index.html' and open in the browser of choice. (browsers may have varying renditions of the site)
- You have successfully loaded my first website.

It may be a lot to take in as it was a playground for me when I was learning HTML CSS and JS. I have sense then revamped this site with some of the new ideas I had and made the site responsive and then decided to make it my portfolio page which is running at the following URL:
